        <!-- Principle 1 -->
        <div class="principle-card">
            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>1. Start With Your Audience</h2>
                <p>Great content isn't about you, it's about them. Dive deep into your audience's world. Understand their challenges, goals, and questions to create content that resonates and solves real problems.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Interview one customer this week. Ask them "What's the biggest challenge you're facing right now related to [your industry]?"</div>

        <!-- Principle 2 -->
        <div class="principle-card">
            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>2. Create Unique, High-Value Content</h2>
                <p>Don't just echo what everyone else is saying. Differentiate yourself by sharing proprietary data, offering a unique perspective, or mastering a specific content style. Be the signal, not the noise.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> What is a common industry belief you disagree with? Write a post about your counter-intuitive perspective.</div>

        <!-- Principle 3 -->
        <div class="principle-card">
            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>3. Build Authority, Not Just Fame</h2>
                <p>Likes and views are fleeting. Authority is evergreen. Focus on creating expert content that builds trust and positions you as the go-to resource in your niche. This is the foundation of long-term success.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Answer the top 3 questions your sales team gets and turn them into a detailed blog post or video.</div>

        <!-- Principle 4 -->
        <div class="principle-card">
            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>4. Quality & Consistency Over Everything</h2>
                <p>Bad content is worse than no content. It erodes trust and damages your brand. Set a high quality bar and maintain a consistent publishing schedule to build a loyal, engaged audience.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Define your "minimum viable quality" standard. What are the non-negotiables every piece of content must have before it goes live?</div>

        <!-- Principle 5 -->
        <div class="principle-card">
            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>5. Repurpose, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
                <p>Don't let your great content die after one use. Maximize your efforts by repurposing pillar content into multiple formats for different channels. One webinar can become a dozen assets.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Take your most popular piece of content and brainstorm 5 new ways you can present it (e.g., carousel, short video, checklist, tweet thread).</div>

        <!-- Principle 6 -->

            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>6. Extend Your Zone of Influence</h2>
                <p>Great content acts as a magnet, pulling prospects into your orbit. It expands your visibility and authority, creating a powerful inbound engine that brings qualified leads to you.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Collaborate with another expert in a complementary niche for a joint webinar or co-authored article to tap into their audience.</div>

        <!-- Principle 7 -->
        <div class="principle-card">
            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>7. Create a Feedback Loop</h2>
                <p>Content should be a conversation, not a monologue. Actively listen to your audience through comments, DMs, surveys, and calls. Use these insights to fuel your content engine with what they truly want.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> End your next piece of content with a specific question to encourage comments and gather direct feedback.</div>

                <h2>8. Build an Easy-Entry Offer</h2>
                <p>Content attracts, but a great offer converts. Create a low-risk, high-value front-end offer to turn your audience into customers. This is the critical first step in your value ladder.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Create a valuable resource (e.g., a comprehensive template, a mini-course) and offer it for a nominal price to convert lurkers into buyers.</div>

            <div class="principle-text">
                <h2>9. Be Patient and Persistent</h2>
                <p>Content marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes time to build momentum and see significant results. Stay consistent, trust the process, and the inbound flow will follow.</p>
                <div class="action-tip"><strong>Action Tip:</strong> Commit to your content strategy for at least 6 months. Track your progress not just in leads, but in authority-building metrics like keyword rankings and branded search volume.</div>
